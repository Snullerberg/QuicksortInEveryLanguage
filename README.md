# QuicksortInEveryLanguage

###The classic QuickSort algorithm in as many languages as possible: A self proposed challenge.
####Project where I expose myself to as many different programming languages I can stand.


For every implementation i use the following data sample.

```javascript
Random
(572, -856,  483,  -74,  901, 
-399,  207,  692,  -52, -908, 
 317,  145, -501,  623,    0, 
-310,   25, -657,  448,    9)
```

```python
Sorted
(-908, -856, -657, -501, -399,
 -310,  -74,  -52,    0,    9,
   25,  145,  207,  317,  448,
  483,  572,  623,  692,  901)
```
