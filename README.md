# QuicksortInEveryLanguage

The classic QuickSort algorithm in as many languages as possible: A self proposed challenge.
Project where I expose myself to as many different programming languages I can stand.


For every implementation i use the following data sample.

(572,-856, 483, -74, 901, 
-399, 207, 692, -52,-908, 
 317, 145,-501, 623, 0, 
-310,  25,-657, 448, 9)
